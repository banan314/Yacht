#Adding a glut DLL reference
I would suggest focusing on freeglut library (freeglut.lib, glew32.lib).
Things you can try include: NuGet freeglut package, adding new include/library directories to VC project, pasting lib and dll files into the main directory, cleaning Debug directory from unnecessary files.
